Numerous cases of death and injuries due to malfunction of 
cyber-physical devices such as  pacemakers have been reported.
In 1990-2000, close to 200,000 pacemakers have been recalled
due to software related failures~\cite{alemzadeh13}.
 One reason that these malfunctions
arise is due to the lack of proper validation.
Unlike the ideas of hardware-in-the-loop testing [ref],
it is not possible to test on actual heart.
Further, unlike the hardware that is almost identical 
during mass production, each individual heart is different.
