\section{Conclusions}

While this paper focuses on the example of cardiac pacemakers.
The proposed code generation for emulation of plant is applicable 
beyond medical domain.
We show this during the experiments in Section~\ref{sec:benchmarking}.


For the hear model, while maintaining real-time response,
 we were able to emulate more than 200 nodes. In contrast,
 the Simulink tool was only capable of emulating 20 nodes. 
 This shows the proposed emulation approach is much superior than 
 the popular Simulink tool.
