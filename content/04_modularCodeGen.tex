\section{Modular code generation}
\label{sec:codeGen}

In this section we present our approach for modular code generation from
a network of \acp{HIOA} as it is implemented in our tool, called
\ourTool. It is a two step procedure as presented previously in
Figure~\ref{fig:overview}. Firstly, we create a \ac{FSM} where all \acp{ODE} 
from the \ac{HIOA} are replaced by their so called witness functions, i.e.,
static numerical solutions. We describe the translation of the \acp{ODE}
to their equivalent witness functions in
Section~\ref{sec:converting-odes-into} followed by code generation for a
single \ac{HIOA} through the use of a Mealy \ac{FSM} in
Section~\ref{sec:backendCodeGeneration}.

\subsection{Converting the \acp{ODE} into equivalent witness functions}
\label{sec:converting-odes-into}

Given the \ac{ODE} for $\dot{v_x}$ in location $\mathbf{q_0}$ of the
heart node, \ac{HIOA} defined in Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellHA}
(reproduced in Equation~(\ref{eq:ode})), the witness function computes
the updated value of $v_{x}$ (denoted $v'_{x}$) at discrete time
instants, separated by the so called time step $\delta$
($\delta \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$), using the forward Euler method.  

The witness function, for the \ac{ODE} evolving $v_{x}$, implementing
the forward Euler method is shown in Equation~(\ref{eq:euler_equiv}).
Equation~(\ref{eq:euler_equiv}) evolves $v_{x}$ \emph{iteratively} while
the invariant condition on location $\mathbf{q_{0}}$ ($v < V_{T}$)
holds. The initial value from which $v_{x}$ starts evolving, in
$\mathbf{q_{0}}$ is either: (1) specified by the programmer in the
$Init$ predicate or (2) the final value of $v_{x}$ when an instantaneous
transition is made from location $\mathbf{q_{3}}$ or $\mathbf{q_{1}}$ to 
$\mathbf{q_{0}}$, shown as update $v^{\prime}_{x} = v_{x}$ on the edge 
connecting these locations in Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellHA}.

  v^\prime_x = v_x + \delta \times (C_{1} v_x)

% This iterative evolution of the continuous variables at discrete points
% in time is akin to transitions on a logical \emph{tick} of a synchronous
% program~\cite{benveniste03}. A likeness that we will exploit when
% composing multiple \ac{HIOA} together in Section~\ref{sec:composition}.

\subsection{Backend code generation for a single \ac{HIOA}}
\label{sec:backendCodeGeneration}


In order to facilitate code generation, each \ac{HIOA} is transformed
into a simple Mealy \ac{FSM}. The \ac{FSM} generated from the \ac{HIOA}
in Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellHA} is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellFSM}.

The translation from a single \ac{HIOA} to its \ac{FSM} representation
is a two step procedure:

%\begin{enumerate}
(1) \textit{Translating locations into states}: The first step
  translates each location in the \ac{HIOA} into a state in the
  \ac{FSM}. Hence, the set of locations $\{q_{0}, q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}\}$
  have an equivalent named set of states in the generated \ac{FSM}.

(2) \textit{Translating each edge in the \ac{HIOA} to a transition in
    the \ac{FSM}}: The second step translates each edge ($e$) in the
  \ac{HIOA} into an equivalent transition ($t$) in the \ac{FSM}. Every
  transition ($t$) in the \ac{FSM} is of the form:
  $\frac{guard}{update}$. The $guard$ precedent is the conjunction of
  the set $\Sigma_{EI} \cup \{\tau\}$ and the conditions specified in
  the $Jump$ predicate on edge $e$. The $update$ antecedent is the
  conjunction of the set $\Sigma_{EO}$ and the update extracted from the $Jump$ 
  predicate on edge $e$. For example, the
  edge $(q_{0}, \tau, \emptyset, q_{1})$ with the $Jump$ predicate as
  shown in Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellHA} translated into a transition in
  the generated \ac{FSM} is
  $\frac{\tau \wedge g(\vec{v_{I}}) \geq V_{T}}{v^{\prime}_{x} = 0.3v,
    v^{\prime}_{y}=0.0v, v^{\prime}_{z}=0.7v, \theta^{\prime}=v/V_{T}}$. Note, 
  that in
  Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellFSM}, we have ignored the $\tau$ events,
  because they always evaluate to $true$.

%\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
	\centering \input{figures/cellFSM}
	\caption{\acf{FSM} of a heart node \label{fig:heartCellFSM}. We ignore
		the $\tau$ event in the \ac{FSM}, because it always evaluates to
		$true$.}
\end{figure}
% Two initial steps are performed: (1) for each location in the
% \ac{HIOA} there is a corresponding state in the \ac{FSM} of the same
% name and (2) for each inter-location edge $e$ in the \ac{HIOA} there
% is a corresponding transition $t$ between the same two states. Each
% transition $t$ has a condition equal to the input events of $e$
% conjuncted with the conditions in $Jump(e)$, and output equal to the
% output events of $e$ combined with the updates present in $Jump(e)$.

The aforementioned steps generate an \ac{FSM} that is able to capture
the instantaneous transitions across locations called
\textit{inter-location} transitions, but is unable to capture the
evolution of the continuous variables via the \acp{ODE}. In order to
replicate the continuous evolution of variables within the locations, we
create \textit{self-transitions} on each state in the \ac{FSM}. A
self-transition by definition has the same source and target state,
e.g., transition from state $\mathbf{q_{0}}$ to $\mathbf{q_{0}}$ as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellFSM}. The invariant from the initial
\ac{HIOA} becomes the \emph{guard} of the self-transition, and the witness
functions for each of the \acp{ODE} described in
Section~\ref{sec:converting-odes-into} become the \emph{update} of the
transition.

Inter-location transitions may be enabled by external inputs (continuous 
variables from set $X_{EI}$ or discrete events from set $\Sigma_{EI}$). For 
example, the edge connecting $\mathbf{q_{0}}$ to $\mathbf{q_{1}}$, in 
Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellHA},
is enabled as soon as the aggregate voltage of neighbouring node
($g(\vec{v_{I}})$) is greater than or equal to some threshold voltage
$V_{T}$. In order to ensure that such inter-location transitions are
enabled correctly, we need to enforce that all self-transitions in the
generated \ac{FSM} are the lowest priority transitions. This is
accomplished by updating the guard condition of the self-transitions as
follows, where $T$ is a set of all the transitions from the state:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  $guard \leftarrow guard \wedge \neg \bigvee_{\forall t \in
    T} guard(t)$
\end{itemize}

The self-transitions on states $\mathbf{q_{0}}$ and $\mathbf{q_{1}}$ in the 
\ac{FSM} in Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellFSM} illustrate this.

% to be conjuncted with the negation of the disjunction of all conditions
% of egress transitions from the state, i.e.
% $Cond(self) \wedge \neg (Cond(trans_{0}) \vee \dots \vee
% Cond(trans_{n})$.
% For location $\mathbf{q_0}$ in the \ac{HIOA} the invariant $v < V_{T}$
% will become a self transition on state $\mathbf{q_0}$ in the \ac{FSM}
% with a condition of $v < V_{T} \wedge \neg (g(\vec{v_{I}}) \geq V_{T})$.
% The final corresponding \ac{FSM} for the \ac{HIOA} from
% Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellHA} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:heartCellFSM}.

Each of the generated \acp{FSM} in the network may be individually
transformed into a switch case statement in `C'-code as a \texttt{Step} 
function, with corresponding \texttt{Initialization} and \texttt{Input-Output}
functions to initialize the \ac{FSM} and communicate with its
environment, respectively.

% The \acp{FSM} is then transformed into C code which contains an
% \emph{Initialisation Function} corresponding to the $Init$ of the
% \ac{HIOA} as well as the setting of the initial state, and a \emph{Run
%   Function} which, given an existing state $l$ and values for all
% variables $X$ and events $\Sigma$, performs a single transition and
% updates any variables or events that may have changed.
